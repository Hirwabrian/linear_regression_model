## Mission

**To examine how economic and spatial hierarchies continue to shape access to secondary education in African countries and exposing how regional underdevelopment, gendered inequalities, and structural poverty remain entrenched barriers to educational justice.**

This project uses data-driven modeling to explore how socio-economic status, gender, and geography affect access to secondary education with a focus on identifying patterns of exclusion that persist despite overall national progress.

## ðŸ“¦ Why Zimbabwe (2014 MICS) Was Chosen

The **Zimbabwe Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) 2014** was selected as a case study for the following reasons:

***Nationally representative data** with rich education indicators (attendance, attainment, dropout)
* Includes key predictors aligned with our mission:

  * **Wealth index** for structural poverty
  * **Urban/rural residence** for spatial exclusion
  * **Sex and age** for gendered analysis
* **Subnational granularity** â€” allows disaggregation by province/region, enabling spatial inequality modeling
* Comes with **standardized survey weights**, ensuring statistical robustness
* Produced by **UNICEF** using international standards, ensuring reliability and comparability across African contexts

> While the study focuses on Zimbabwe, it is framed as a **representative case of broader structural challenges** in African education systems. The findings are not meant to generalize all contexts but to illuminate recurring patterns of marginalization grounded in economic and spatial hierarchies.
