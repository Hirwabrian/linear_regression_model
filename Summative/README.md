### Mission

**To investigate how economic and spatial hierarchies shape secondary school completion among girls in African countries — exposing how regional underdevelopment, rural disadvantage, and structural poverty persist as entrenched barriers to educational justice.**

This project applies data-driven modeling to understand which socio-economic and geographic factors most strongly influence the probability of completing secondary school. While education access has improved nationally in many African contexts, this analysis focuses on those **who remain excluded despite this progress** — aiming to surface the **hidden patterns of marginalization** that disproportionately affect girls in under-resourced regions.

### Why Zimbabwe (2014 MICS) Was Chosen

The **Zimbabwe Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) 2014** was selected as a case study for the following reasons:

* **Nationally representative** and produced by UNICEF using internationally comparable standards.
* Provides rich education-related indicators: attendance, completion, and attainment.
* Includes key variables aligned with the mission:

  * **Wealth quintile (`windex5`)** as a proxy for structural poverty.
  * **Urban/rural residence (`HH6`)** to capture spatial inequality.
  * **Subnational region (`HH7`)** to explore geographic variation in opportunity.
  * **Age (`HL7`)** and **gender (`HL4`)** to account for demographic disparities.
* Enables regional analysis with statistically weighted survey responses.

> **Note on Scope:**
> Due to the structure of the dataset, nearly all respondents with complete education data in the relevant age group are **female**. As a result, this project focuses specifically on **girls’ educational outcomes** — a framing that aligns with known gender disparities in access across sub-Saharan Africa. Rather than limiting the analysis, this provides an opportunity to critically examine how economic and spatial inequalities intersect with gender to shape life chances.

> **Note on Target Imbalance:**
> While the majority of respondents in this sample have completed secondary school, a significant portion have not. The model is designed to analyze this divergence — surfacing which features most predict exclusion in a context of increasing, but uneven, educational attainment.
